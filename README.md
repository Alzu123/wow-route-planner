# World of Warcraft route planner
This is a small project to create a route guide for World of Warcraft. It takes teleports into account and calculates the fastest way to get from one place on Azeroth to the other.

## How to use
The planner is hosted here in GitHub at https://alzu123.github.io/wow-route-planner/. To plan a route, you can either search for locations from the search boxes on the left, or click the start and end points on the map. You can then select a route from a few relatively good possibilities.
